### About Me

My interest in Artificial Intelligence was first sparked at a Computer Vision Hackathon. I was completely awed by the idea that a machine could learn to see. That moment of wonder sent me straight into learning Python. 

My curiosity eventually led me to MLOps & MLE role at Tata Consultancy Services. I built the real-world infrastructure that AI depends on, getting deep into distributed learning and the core principles of MLOps. That experience only fueled my curiosity, which is what pushed me to pursue my Master's in AI. I took advanced coursework spanning Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

Intrigued by the Generative AI's potential, I took advanced courses from deeplearning.ai. To understand exactly how it all worked from the inside out I built a conversational chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

I love the entire process from building the rock-solid foundations to creating the spark of a new Generative AI experience. I'm looking for a team that gets as excited as I do about rapidly co-create incredible things with AI.

### Featured Project: AI-Powered Chatbot for YouTube Videos

This project is an interactive chatbot that allows users to have a conversation with any YouTube video. It uses a RAG pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on the video's auto-generated transcript.

* **Transcription:** `OpenAI Whisper` for highly accurate audio-to-text conversion.
* **Semantic Search:** `FAISS` and `Sentence Transformers` for indexing and retrieving relevant information.
* **Language Model:** `Llama 3` via the `Groq API` for real-time, streaming responses.
* **User Interface:** Built with `Streamlit` for a fast, interactive user experience.
